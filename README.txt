****Optimized Uploads:******

To optimize large file uploads (10-20GB) to your own edge node storage, implement a **resumable, parallel chunked upload system** with server/client optimizations. Here's the complete solution:

---

### **1. Core Architecture: Resumable Chunked Uploads**
- **Why**: Avoids restarting failed transfers and enables parallelism.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Client splits files into 50-100MB chunks (smaller = better resilience, larger = less overhead)
  2. Upload chunks in parallel
  3. Server reassembles chunks after validation

---

### **2. Server-Side Implementation**
#### **A. Endpoint Design**
```python
# FastAPI/Python Example (adapt to your stack)
@app.post("/upload-chunk")
async def upload_chunk(
    upload_id: str,  # Unique session ID
    chunk_index: int,  # e.g., 0, 1, 2...
    total_chunks: int,
    file: UploadFile
):
    # Save chunk to temp dir with naming: {upload_id}_{chunk_index}.part
    # Verify checksum (e.g., SHA-256)
    return {"status": "ok"}

@app.post("/finalize-upload")
def finalize_upload(upload_id: str, filename: str, original_checksum: str):
    # 1. Combine chunks: cat {upload_id}_*.part > filename
    # 2. Validate reassembled file's checksum
    # 3. Delete temp chunks
    return {"status": "complete"}
```

#### **B. Storage Optimization**
- **Temp storage**: Use SSD-backed storage for chunk assembly
- **File system**: Configure for large files (e.g., XFS/EXT4 on Linux)
- **Concurrency**: Use async I/O (e.g., Node.js, Python Async)

---

### **3. Client-Side Implementation**
#### **A. Browser Client (JavaScript)**
```javascript
// Using TUS protocol (https://tus.io)
const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: "https://your-edge-node.com/uploads",
  chunkSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB
  parallelUploads: 4, // Concurrent chunks
  retryDelays: [0, 1000, 3000, 5000],
  metadata: { filename: file.name },
  onError: (error) => { /* handle */ },
  onSuccess: () => { /* notify */ }
});
upload.start();
```

#### **B. Desktop Client (Python)**
```python
# Using requests + threading
def upload_chunk(upload_id, chunk, index):
    requests.post(
        url=f"https://your-edge-node.com/upload-chunk?upload_id={upload_id}&index={index}",
        files={"chunk": chunk},
        timeout=120
    )

with open("large_file.zip", "rb") as f:
    chunks = iter(lambda: f.read(100 * 1024 * 1024), b"")  # 100MB chunks
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) as executor:  # Parallel uploads
        executor.map(upload_chunk, [chunk_id]*len(chunks), chunks, range(len(chunks)))
```

### **4. Network & Infrastructure Optimizations**
| **Component**       | **Optimization**                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Edge Server**      | - Enable HTTP/2/3 for multiplexing <br> - Configure TCP BBR congestion control (Linux) |
| **Reverse Proxy**    | - Increase timeouts (Nginx: `client_max_body_size 0; proxy_read_timeout 1h;`) <br> - Enable gzip compression for metadata |
| **Bandwidth**        | - Prioritize uploads with QoS (e.g., `tc` on Linux) <br> - Limit per-client bandwidth if needed |
| **Geographic Access**| Deploy edge nodes near heavy user bases using Anycast DNS or regional DNS        |

---

### **5. Critical Enhancements**
- **Resumability**:
  - Store chunk status in Redis/SQLite to resume interrupted sessions
  - Client should track uploaded chunks
- **Security**:
  - Pre-signed upload URLs with expiration
  - Validate chunk checksums (SHA-256)
  - Rate limiting per client
- **Efficiency**:
  - **Zero-copy reassembly**: Use `fallocate` (Linux) or `FileChannel.transferTo()` (Java) for chunk merging
  - **Compression**: Apply LZ4/Zstandard if files are compressible

---

### **6. Tools & Libraries**
| **Purpose**         | **Recommendation**                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol Standard    | [tus.io](https://tus.io) (open resumable upload protocol) |
| Browser Client       | [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client)    |
| Python Client        | [tus-py-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-py-client)    |
| File Splitting (CLI) | `split -b 100M largefile.bin chunk_` (Linux/macOS)       |
| Network Testing      | `iperf3` to validate server bandwidth                    |

---

### **7. Performance Benchmarks**
Expect **3-8x faster uploads** compared to single-threaded:
- Baseline (1 thread): ~100 Mbps → 20GB in ~27 mins
- Optimized (6 threads + HTTP/3): ~500 Mbps → **~5.5 mins**

---

### **Deployment Checklist**
1. [ ] Configure server timeouts and buffers
2. [ ] Implement chunk validation with checksums
3. [ ] Set up temp storage with SSD/NVMe
4. [ ] Enable HTTP/3 (QUIC) on edge nodes
5. [ ] Add client retry logic with exponential backoff
6. [ ] Test failure recovery (kill client mid-upload)

This architecture ensures **resilient, high-speed uploads** while leveraging your edge infrastructure. For enterprise needs, consider commercial solutions like [Filestash](https://www.filestash.app) or [MinIO](https://min.io) for S3-compatible implementations.


/************************* Upload Optmization Techniques *********************************************/

1. Chunking & Upload Pipeline
What to do
* On the client (web app using tus-js-client), break files into 2–8 MiB chunks.
* Compute a content hash (e.g. SHA‑256) per chunk before uploading.
How it fits
* tus already gives you chunked, resumable uploads. Hook into its onBeforeRequest or onAfterResponse callbacks to compute and send your hash in a custom header.
* On the server (FastAPI), read that header and check your PostgreSQL index table (chunk_hash → storage_id) before accepting the chunk—if it already exists, skip storing the payload and just record a reference in your “object manifest” table.
Libraries / Snippets
* Python: use hashlib.sha256() over the incoming bytes.
* PostgreSQL schema: CREATE TABLE chunks (
*   id           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
*   hash         CHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
*   storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
*   size_bytes   INTEGER NOT NULL
* );
* CREATE TABLE object_manifests (
*   object_id    UUID PRIMARY KEY,
*   version      INT,
*   chunk_index  INT,
*   chunk_hash   CHAR(64) REFERENCES chunks(hash)
* );
* 

2. Compression (Zstd)
What to do
* Once a new chunk arrives, compress it before writing to disk.
How it fits
* In your FastAPI upload endpoint, wrap the raw bytes in a Zstd compressor (e.g. zstandard).
* Store the compressed blob under storage/{first2(hash)}/{hash}.zst.
Code sketch
import zstandard as zstd

def store_chunk(raw_bytes, hash):
    cctx = zstd.ZstdCompressor(level=3)           # tune level for speed
    comp = cctx.compress(raw_bytes)
    path = f"/data/chunks/{hash[:2]}/{hash}.zst"
    with open(path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(comp)
    return path

3. Deduplication & CAS
* By using the hash as your chunk key, you get content‑addressed storage (CAS) by default.
* PostgreSQL’s unique constraint on chunks.hash ensures only one copy per unique chunk.

4. Redundancy: Erasure Coding vs. Replication
Options
1. Simple replication on your home server:
    * Keep two local copies on separate drives (e.g., RAID 1 software mirror).
    * Pros: trivial; Cons: 2× overhead, entire‑disk failover.
2. Erasure coding via a library like PyECLib or Jerasure bindings:
    * Split each compressed chunk into, say, 6 data + 3 parity shards → 1.5× overhead.
    * Store shards across multiple USB‑HDDs or even across two machines if you add a second Pi/mini-PC.
Integration point
* After compression, feed the compressed bytes into your EC library to produce shards.
* Round‑robin write shards to distinct mount points.

5. Metadata Store & Performance
* You already have PostgreSQL for manifests—keep all your chunk hashes, object manifests, and shard‑locations here.
* Ensure your PG instance is on an SSD (even a small NVMe stick) to keep lookups sub‑millisecond.

6. Tiered Storage
* Hot: Most‑recently uploaded chunks remain on your SSD.
* Warm: Move chunks older than 7 days to your secondary HDD (with a cron job that updates a “tier” flag in PG).
* Cold: If you want long‑term archive offsite, you could add a daily rsync to an inexpensive cloud‑bucket.

7. Putting It All Together
1. Upload
    * Client: chunk → hash → tus upload (with hash header).
    * FastAPI: check PG for chunks.hash.
        * If exists, record manifest row only.
        * Else: compress → erasure‑code/shard → write shards → insert chunks row + manifest row.
2. Read
    * Given an object ID and version, fetch its chunks from object_manifests.
    * For each chunk: locate its shards via PG → reassemble (if EC) → decompress → stream to client.
3. Maintenance
    * Cron job to tier cold data.
    * Periodic PG VACUUM/INDEX maintenance to keep lookups fast.

Why This Works for Your Edge Project
* Bandwidth‑efficient: tus + dedupe + compression minimize upstream traffic.
* Cost‑effective: only ~1.2–1.6× raw data stored vs. simple 2× mirror.
* Scalable: PostgreSQL and file‑path directories handle millions of chunks easily.
* Resilient: Erasure coding lets you lose drives or even machines without data loss.
All of these pieces are open‑source and have Python bindings, so you can prototype end‑to‑end in days. Once you’ve got the basic chunk → compress → store pipeline, you can layer on tiering, EC, and archive policies incrementally.
